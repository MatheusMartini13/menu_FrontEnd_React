# Matt Menu

Live at: https://menu-matt.onrender.com/

Matt Menu is already live in a demo version! But this is still a work in progress! It is an ugly menu, so the next step is to improve this aspect.
This is a front-end project that I created in my free time just to show the functionalities of my menu-API. It is a very simple page.

## Functionalities
- Login (username: admin | password: admin);
- All products page view;
- Show more about one Product;
- Edit a Product;
- Delete a Product;
- Add a new Product;

## Know Bugs
- Page is not Responsive. So it is recommended to use a notebook or a PC. Poor performance in android or IOS (already tested).
- Page is ugly.

## Next Implementations
- Unfortunatelly login is mandatory to get products, but in the future I plan to change the getAllProducts and getProducts routes in the backend so I can show the products to people not logged in. The login could focus in the administrators and in Edit, Patch and Delete routes. I can't change this right now because my back-end is part of a job-offer test.
- Changes in Design;
- Images upload;
- In the all products main view, group products by category.
