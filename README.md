# Matt Menu

Matt Menu is already live in a demo version! But this is still a work in progress!
This is a front-end project that I created in my free time just to show the functionalities of my menu-API. It is a very simple page.

## Working Functionalities
- Login;
- All products page view
- Show one Product with a dedicated get request (as it should be better to use the data already fetched when getting all products)

## Know Bugs
- New Product Button do not work (Not actually a bug, but whatever)

## Next Implementations
- Edit Product;
- Delete Product;
- New Product;
- General optimization, maybe.
